## This is where you put all of your Laravel Application files.

You can either do any of the following:

- Clone your github repo / project directly into this folder (the one where you have your `app` folder)
- Create a freshly installed Laravel application by running `docker-compose run --rm composer create-project laravel/laravel .` in your terminal.

You can delete this file once you have already set-up your Laravel Application.
